<p> ZAK team's code for the VEXVR Challenge 2022 - Spin Up. We decided to stick to a Mecanum drive after careful consideration, we also came up with numerous attacking and defensive strategies to use throughout the competition. </p>

The main reason for choosing this design was due to it's solid ability to strafe which would be really useful to push the discs into the low goal area of the board, we were also considering adding some roller mechanisms due to the high amount of points you get on the side of the map, this repository will be updated as soon as changes to the robot are made.
